Cambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: Khmer classical
dance, folk dance, and social dances. The exact origins of Khmer classical dance
are disputed. Most native Khmer scholars trace modern dance forms back to the
time of Angkor, seeing similarities in the temple engravings of the period,
while others hold that modern Khmer dance styles were learned (or re-learned)
from Siamese court dancers in the 1800s. Khmer classical dance is the form of
stylised performance art established in the royal courts of Cambodia exhibited
for both entertainment and ceremonial purposes.[255] The dances are performed by
intricately costumed, highly trained men and women on public occasions for
tribute, invocation or to enact traditional stories and epic poems such as
Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana.

[256] Known formally as Robam Preah Reach Troap (របាំព្រះរាជទ្រព្យ "theater of
royal wealth") it is set to the music of a pinpeat ensemble accompanied by a
vocal chorus.Cambodian folk dance, often performed to mahori music, celebrates
the various cultural and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Folk dances originated in
the villages and are performed, for the most part, by the villagers for the
villagers.[257] The movements are less stylised and the clothing worn is that of
the people the dancers are portraying, such as hill tribes, Chams or farmers.
Typically faster-paced than classical dance, folk dances display themes of the
"common person" such as love, comedy or warding off evil spirits.[257] Social
dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or other informal
social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are analogous to those of
other Southeast Asian nations. Examples include the circle dances Romvong and
Romkbach as well as Saravan and Lam Leav. Modern western popular dances
including Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison, have also influenced Cambodian
social dance.
