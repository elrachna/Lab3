      Rice is the staple grain, as in other Southeast Asian countries. Fish from
      the Mekong and Tonlé Sap rivers is also an important part of the diet. The
      supply of fish and fish products for food and trade as of 2000 was 20
      kilograms (44 pounds) per person or 2 ounces per day per person.[243] Some
      of the fish can be made into prahok for longer storage. The cuisine of
      Cambodia contains tropical fruits, soups and noodles. Key ingredients are
      kaffir lime, lemon grass, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, tamarind, ginger,
      oyster sauce, coconut milk and black pepper. >

      Some delicacies are num banhchok (នំបញ្ចុក), fish amok (អាម៉ុកត្រី) and
      aping (អាពីង). The country also boasts various distinct local street
      foods. French influence on Cambodian cuisine includes the Cambodian red
      curry with toasted baguette bread. The toasted baguette pieces are dipped
      in the curry and eaten. Cambodian red curry is also eaten with rice and
      rice vermicelli noodles. Probably the most popular dine out dish, kuyteav,
      is a pork broth rice noodle soup with fried garlic, scallions, green
      onions that may also contain various toppings such as beef balls, shrimp,
      pork liver or lettuce. Kampot pepper is reputed to be the best in the
      world and accompanies crab at the Kep crab shacks and squid in the
      restaurants on the Ou Trojak Jet river.
