      Football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports, although professional
      organised sports are not as prevalent in Cambodia as in western countries
      because of the economic conditions. Soccer was brought to Cambodia by the
      French and became popular with the locals.[254] The Cambodia national
      football team managed fourth in the 1972 Asian Cup, but development has
      slowed since the civil war. Western sports such as basketball, volleyball,
      bodybuilding, field hockey, rugby union, golf, and baseball are gaining
      popularity. Volleyball is by far the most popular sport in the
      country[citation needed]. Native sports include traditional boat racing,
      buffalo racing, Pradal Serey, Khmer traditional wrestling and Bokator.
      Cambodia first participated in the Olympics during the 1956 Summer Olympic
      Games sending equestrian riders. Cambodia also hosted the GANEFO Games in
      1966 and recently, the SEA Games in 2023.
