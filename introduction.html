      Various factors contribute to the Cambodian culture including Theravada
      Buddhism, Hinduism, French colonialism, Angkorian culture, and modern
      globalization. The Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts is
      responsible for promoting and developing Cambodian culture. Cambodian
      culture not only includes the culture of the lowland ethnic majority, but
      also some 20 culturally distinct hill tribes colloquially known as the
      Khmer Loeu, a term coined by Norodom Sihanouk to encourage unity between
      the highlanders and lowlanders.

      Rural Cambodians wear a krama scarf which is a unique aspect of Cambodian
      clothing. The sampeah is a traditional Cambodian greeting or a way of
      showing respect to others. Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the
      Khmer empire, has distinctive styles of dance, architecture, and
      sculpture, which have been exchanged with neighbouring Laos and Thailand
      throughout history. Angkor Wat (Angkor means "city" and Wat means
      "temple") is the best-preserved example of Khmer architecture from the
      Angkorian era along with hundreds of other temples that have been
      discovered in and around the region. Traditionally, the Khmer people have
      a recorded information on Tra leaves. Tra leaf books record legends of the
      Khmer people, the Ramayana, the origin of Buddhism and other prayer books.
      They are taken care of by wrapping in cloth to protect from moisture and
      the climate.
